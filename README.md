# Paseo Releases
> ⚠️ NOTE: These builds are provided for development purposes only!

This repo provides cross-platform builds of the Paseo Network chain spec generator for usage with [`pop-cli`](https://github.com/r0gue-io/pop-cli) only. 

Builds are generated using the release tags at https://github.com/paseo-network/runtimes, along with any Rust compiler version noted within the release notes of each release. 

The [workflow](./.github/workflows/release.yml) generates the cross-platform binaries and creates a corresponding release with the same release tag. The corresponding commit hash is added to the release notes for additional verification.

- Linux
  - `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`
  - `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`
